See point 3.\r\n\t \r\n\td) Don't panic, the script is provided with a sample DB.\r\n\r\n3) push the button \"Taglist\", then \"Refresh Taglist\" this will fill the 'tags' table with tags added in 'messages' table. Each time you add a message with new tags you have to rebuild the list.\r\n\r\n4) Go to localhost/onfly/ to see your app, change styles, header, footer, background as you like.\r\n\r\n5) Upload to your site without the admin/ folder.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nDBMS: the DB interface is provided by a modified version of phpliteadmin (https://code.google.com/p/phpliteadmin/)\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\nThis is first release, the script is not sure. \r\nSee sqlite documentation to see how give the right permissions to your DB file.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
